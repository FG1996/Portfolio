Solution to the following problem:

Given:
 struct node_t
 {
 unsigned v;
 struct node_t* next;
 };
A singly linked list of nodes is referred to by a pointer to the head node (the head pointer will be
NULL in the case of an empty list).
Write a function:
struct node_t* even_nodes(struct node_t**)
which is passed a pointer to the head pointer of a list. It should remove all nodes with even
values from the indicated list, putting them in a new list, which is returned. 

  SumEvenFib

Provides the sum of the first 100 even fibonacci numbers.

  SortedMergeSortedLists

Merges 2 input sorted lists into 1 list that is also sorted.

  4 - General Test

Solution to the following problem:

Write a function in a language of your choice which is passed two unsigned integers, a value
and a base. It should print the supplied value in the supplied base. The base is in the range 2
to 36, and digit values greater than 9 are represented in the output by the alphabetic characters
such that 10 is 'A' etc.

  SumEvenSquare
  
Returns the sum of the square of the even numbers that are in an input list.

  NewAlphabeyOrder
  
Solution to the following problem:

You are given a list of words made up of the 26 lower case letters. The list is sorted according
to a modified alphabetical order, i.e. instead of ‘a’ to ‘z’, the letters are ordered in some arbitrary
different order. Write a Python program which, when given such a list works out and displays a
possible alphabetical ordering consistent with the sequence of words.
